# Flower-shop

A code repo for basic flower shop website using HTML and CSS and few micro- macro animations.


Hey there ! am writing this repo a bit of description compared to my previous repos , 

I was taking this course of web development on YT by https://github.com/HuXn-WebDev , and had a dummy project which named "Coffee-shop" but the thing is, i didn't get the working when i created it for the first time, and the UI didn't satisfy me , 

So this repo is the next version of "Coffee-shop" but aims to represent a flower-shop commercial, 

I have pretty much managed to make it look clean and flora theme.

Thank you for reading , Have a great day !
